# Contributing to groundwork.js

Thanks for taking the time to contribute back to this project! :+1: We have fairly simple guidelines below.

## Did you find a bug?

* **Has the bug was already been reported?** Search GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/thegroundwork/groundwork.js/issues) to see if the problem has already been filed.
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/thegroundwork/groundwork.js/issues/new). We have an issue template in place when starting new issues, please make sure to fill in all of the relevant information with as much detail as possible.
* Paste or attach any screenshots, animated GIFs, stacktraces or error messages into your issue.

## Suggesting enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/thegroundwork/groundwork.js/issues). Your suggestion will start a discussion with the project maintainers about the suitability of your enhancement. Create an issue and provide the following information:

* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
* Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as Markdown code blocks.
* Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
* Explain why this enhancement would be useful to other developers and isn't something that can or should be implemented within your own application.
* Specify which version of **groundwork.js** you're using.

## Contributing code / Fixing bugs

* Open a new GitHub Pull Request with your patch, bugfix or enhancement.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
* Before submitting:
  * Please follow the Styleguide for commit messages below.
  * Please run ESLint on your code with `npm run lint` and correct any outstanding issues.
  * Please write tests for any new code you introduce, and update any tests for any code you change which is already covered by tests.
  * Please run all of the tests and ensure they pass. Pull Requests cannot be merged until the test suite passes in Travis.

## Styleguide

### Commit messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
